# Paping-Port-Check-Simple-GUI

## :star2: About the Project

Want to ping the specific TCP Ports? use paping instead "ping" on cmd, because ping just hit the ICMP ports 1.

## :toolbox: Installation

Use your best webserver application like xampp, apache, dll.

download the zip files and paste it into htdocs (C:\xampp\htdocs\) on xampp and (var/www/html/) on linux

access it by browser (localhost)

## :handshake: Any Question? Feel free to ask
